## LJ code 201 Day 13

Today we learned about local storage and JSON.  While this was super interesting. As much as I thought I understood it at first, when it came to coding these principles I was more than confused.  I was able to get some help from Jose who really cleared it up for me.  Looking forward to project week, can't wait to see what group I end up with and what project we will be working on.
