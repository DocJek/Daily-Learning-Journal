## LJ code 201 Day 17

Today we got a ton of work done! We were able to iron out the kinks and hit our MVP.  So now we have 2 whole days to work on beautifying and adding features, in other words, the fun stuff.  Not to say making the initial game wasn't fun, but now that we have a working product, I feel like the rest will be an absolute blast!  I have so many ideas I'd like to see implemented in the game, mostly style stuff, but some functionality as well. I'm so excited to see what our team can accomplish tomorrow.
