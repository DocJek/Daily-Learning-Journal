# LJ Code 201 - Day 4

Day 4 of Code Fellows, and so far so good.  The daily assignments were on a war path most of this week, except today.  Today we learned about functions.  Which, not for nothing, is something we've had a lot of practice in from the prework, I'm not complaining though.  I actually really appreciated the break, even if it were for just a day.  We also did some work in a "Pair Programming" enviornment, which was challenging but fun.

I'm expecting tomorrow to be just as insane as the first day.  But I'm ready for it.  I'm really surprised that I understand as much as I have so far.  I've learned so much in such a short amount of time, and yet I know it's only just beginning.  This truly feels like a great fit for me though and I'm excited to see what's next.
