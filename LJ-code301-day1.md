## LJ code 301 Day 1

Today I learned about responsive web design, a concept I've been trying to practice this whole time but didn't realize there was a name for it.  All in all, it was a fun day.  Got to work with Jose on pair programming. Had a few hiccups as Jose seemed to think once he's Driver, that he's also navigator.  It was a bit challenging to try to rein him in.  I'd like the opportunity to pair with him again, though.  Once we were able to figure the team thing out we got the work done pretty quickly. The final TODO was a bit more of a challenge than either one of us expected.  Good lesson!
