# LJ code 201 - Day 6

Yet another horribly difficult day today.  Had the lab going relatively smoothly up until I went to do my final push and then noticed problems with the DOM tree.  Fixed the problems only to have the lists break.  Before fixing the code the lists populated splendidly on the page but now not at all.  So frustrating, and now I'm terrified of falling behind.  It seems like everyone else got theirs to work, I just don't understand what I did wrong.  I've looked over the code over and over again but can't find a problem with the logic.  All I can hope for is hopefully I will have a break through tomorrow so I can fix this problem.
