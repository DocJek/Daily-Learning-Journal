# Daily Learning Journal

## LJ code 301 Day 5

I know I'm supposed to talk about what we learned today, so to that end I will say we went over using forms in a one page web app. More info I barely understand.  In class I get it when it's right in front of me, but when it's me doing the writing I seem to have a harder time understanding.  This portfolio project has all my attention at the moment.  I'm stuck on one of the most basic early lessons taught, without this I won't be able to continue with this project. And I have no idea what to try next to get it to work.  The problem I type of is rendering to the DOM via jQuery scripts.  I realize jQuery is just a simplified query library for JS/ECMA, and that if correctly understood, can make coding with JS much easier.  And while I do believe I have learned a ridiculous amount of information and techniques, I fear I haven't remembered the right keys for this lock.  So what now?  Now, I ask for help, because failure is not an option.
