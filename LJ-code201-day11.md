## LJ code 201 - Day 11

Much harder day today than has been for the last week or so.  Even though I got a decent amount done, I look at my requirements for the project and realize I haven't really done much at all.  Its so frustrating that I can help others but can't seem to help myself.  I keep trying, every day but every day I feel more and more lost. Everyone around me keeps telling me that I'll be fine, I just wish I could see in myself what they seem to see.  So far, it feels like I only know enough to give syntax advice, but not enough to make anything worth while of it.  And now after working on a project I couldn't even finish, I have to go home and work on the reading assignment which is a whole different project.  Ugh! I need a breakthrough really bad.
