#LJ code 201 - Day 8

Today we learned how to place input forms on our webpages. I felt I picked the HTML side of this up pretty well, and even the error handling wasn't too bad.  So far this week this was probably the easiest day.  But still not easy at the same time.  I also was accidentally merged my master to my Day2 branch, which set my lab time back by 2 hours.  Other than that though, this was a pretty awesome day.  Definitely looking forward to whatever is coming next.
