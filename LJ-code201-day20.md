## LJ code 201 day 20

This was our last day of 201.  Our final project, finally completed, with only the presentation left to do.  And personally I believe we did outstanding.  Through all the bumping of heads and clashing, we were still able to work together and function as a team.  I'm super proud of my team, and glad I got to experience what it was like to work in a challenging environment. If nothing else, I know I improved on my leadership skills during this past week.  Before this, I had heard from the TA's and instructor that I was doing pretty well, and while this compliment to my work was not met by deaf ears, it was still a hard pill to swallow.  Though now after some reflection, I have a bit more confidence in my abilities, coding and leadership.  I can't wait to start making mistakes in 301, so I can soak up all of those lessons in the process.
