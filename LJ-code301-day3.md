## LJ code 301 Day 3

Today I learned about jQuery event handlers and tried implementing them, during pair programming, into the ongoing pair project.  All in all it was a good class.  The only hiccups came during pair programming.  While for the most part Sara was awesome to work with.  It's abundantly apparent that she has never worked with someone on a coding project before taking this class.  She drove first, and almost refused to take my instruction or guidance as a her navigator.  Also started using ES6 code that I thought was out of scope.  I simply explained what I believed the case to be in class with out of scope things.  In the end we figured out how to best work with one another, and got most of the project for the day done. Today was difficult, but I learned quite a few lessons in patience, so meh, I'm chalking it up as a win.
