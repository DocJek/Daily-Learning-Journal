# LJ code 201 - Day 10

We did more pair programming on Friday(the day that the 'Day 10' title above refers to). I got the opportunity to work with someone I hadn't worked with before, and face the challenges that uncertainty had to offer.  It was educational for sure, but I think some of the lessons were lost on me.  I messed up again, in the same way as last time.  I merged our master into my branch, effectively erasing my partner's code, on which she worked hard on during our lab time. Or so I thought. Stephanie helped me through it again.  But this time it felt a little more familiar. I could recognize some of the steps that needed to be taken.  And which commands to use. In the end we got it figured out and I was able to recover my partners changes(even though a margin shift I made, set off her icon line-up).  I learned many lessons during this experience about communication and patience. In the reading for Day 11(Monday) I've found so many techniques that we could have used to make that chocolate pizza page a more finished product in a faster amount of time.  But I guess that's how it goes for now, all I can do is try to learn as fast as possible for me.  And hopefully its fast enough for my teachers, Apprenti, and Microsoft as well.
