# Daily Learning Journal

## LJ code 301 Day 11

Today we went over the idea of single page applications and utilizing page.js in our programming.  Overall, this was decently easy to grasp.  Though the lecture made it seem much more difficult than it really was.  I think that may just have been because I'm used to Stephanie, and Scott is a much different type of instructor.  I could tell he's very knowledgeable, just like Stephanie, but doesn't have the bubbly engaging personality.  So the lecture was a bit harder to follow.  Apparently his words weren't lost on me though, as I had a relatively easy time working with Dan on the lab.  Even when faced with errors, I knew how to debug the problem and figure it out.  Speaking of working with Dan, I was hoping to be matched with someone I haven't worked with today but got partnered with Dan the man instead. Nothing against Dan, I've just worked with him so much, I feel like I can read his thoughts.  When he was navigating, I found myself beating him to the punch in typing up the necessary code.  But every experience is a good chance to learn something, so all in all, it was a great day. Can't wait to see what tomorrow will be like!
