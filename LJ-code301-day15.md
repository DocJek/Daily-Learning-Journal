# Daily Learning Journal

## LJ code 301 Day 15

Today we got our groups for Project Week.  I'm with Don and James, which is pretty awesome. We almost chose to take on my project idea, but found too many issues with trying to make it work, so instead went with Don's idea.  Which actually seems like it's going to be fun to do.  I definitely see a need for it here at Code Fellows and according to Don, there's a need for it at WTIA.  It'd be cool to use this project as a way of giving back to them, but I've decided not to put that extra pressure on this project.  In the end it's just a means for a way to test my knowledge level with what was learned this past month.  In our groups today, we started figuring out our plan to take on this assignment and set up our group agreement.  I hope we will work as well as we think we will at this point.  Only thing to do is wait and find out, I guess.
