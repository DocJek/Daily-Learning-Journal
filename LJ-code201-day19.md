## LJ code 201 day 19

Today we worked on putting the finishing touches on gridWARS.  Had quite a few problems with git not letting us pull down the full master version that was apparently available according to github.  Like we could see the version we wanted on github but when we tried to pull, it only gave us part of what was shown.  So there was a lot of back tracking and re-doing.  I like the concept of git and github, but the overall delivery of this system needs work I think.  Tomorrow is our final 201 day, I'm excited and a bit nervous to give the presentation on our project.  The game ended up looking amazing, but it's a bit of a bore since there is only one target on our map.  But no worries, if this were a real game to be launched for people to navigate to and get some enjoyment from, we would have the option to release as is, and then load with updates and upgrades later.  All in all this project served as a series of excellent learning experiences.
