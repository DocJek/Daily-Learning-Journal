## LJ code 201 Day 16

Today we started on the final group projects for 201.  Had a few bumps while coming up with how we were going to approach the game we're creating.  Mainly having to do with one particular person, who seems to feel like they are the only voice that matters.  Though they have been a bit receptive to our inputs, it seems to take telling this person at least 3 times before they get it.  But such is life when working with others.  We were able to start coding our logic a bit, and I believe we're off to a good start.  Tomorrow will be a big day for hashing out the bare bones of our game, which I suspect will be at least running the basics by the end of the day.
