## LJ code 301 Day 13

Today we went over how to deploy a site via Heroku's gui, which honestly I feel I must have blinked at the wrong time and missed the entire lesson because for the life of me I can't remember how to deploy via the GUI.  And unfortunately the Heroku site is of no help because all of the tutorials only show the terminal approach.  I never thought I'd be more comfortable with the terminal than with a GUI. But this is definitely the case for this particular situation.  I kinda wish we could just deploy via the cmd line since there doesn't seem to be any info online on how to do it otherwise.  Today proved to be a very frustrating day, but I'm sure tomorrow will be better.
