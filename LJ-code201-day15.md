## LJ code 201 Day 15

Today we got put into teams for our final project week next week.  I'm teamed with La, John, and Daniel.  So far so good, we had a bit of a bumpy start but we figured it out pretty quickly and have bonded a bit over it. I can't wait to start working with them on our project.  The premise is a battleship-esque minesweeper clone.  I'm super excited to work with Daniel and La as their strongest points are exactly what I've been struggling with, logic in JS. While speaking with Stephanie during my one-on-one today, she told me that Daniel loves to help.  So I think it will be of great benefit to both of us, for me to utilize him during this project.  As for La, she also has a strong grasp on logic but seems to have a harder time with CSS, so I'm thinking trading info with her will be powerful too. This has been a tough ride, and I realize it's going to get more tough as it goes, but I think I'm ready for what's to come.
