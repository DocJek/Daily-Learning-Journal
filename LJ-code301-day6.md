## LJ code 301 Day 6

Today we learned about AJAX and how JSON is used in conjunction with it.  I hardly understood any of it.  From what I could grasp, AJAX sends requests to servers to obtain data for a single section of a page instead of the whole page itself, effectively reducing load times since the page will only need to refresh that section.  It can send these requests over a few different media options, the one we used today was JSON.  JSON is used to packup the data into a string and send it via an AJAX request to a server to retrieve data.  Other than this little summary, I don't really understand much. Hopefully I can find someone to help make it more clear for me.
