# LJ Code 201 - Day 2

Today (Tuesday) was much better than yesterday.  I felt more comfortable with what was learned. Especially in relation to GIT.  I learned about hot keys in ATOM (like the super useful CTRL-arrows to move lines up and down). Brain feels like absolute mush but on the up side it's not nearly as mushy as Monday.
